## Laboratory Work №1

**Task**

* Generate an image of a flag in the console using escape characters, according to your variant (column "Country").
* Generate a repeating pattern in the console (column "Pattern").
* Generate a function graph (1st quadrant) in the console using escape characters, at least 9 rows high (column "Function").
* Using the provided file with a numerical sequence ```sequence.txt```, output a percentage ratio chart according to your variant.

**Additional Task**

Using the console clearing function (```os.system("cls")``` or ```os.system("clear")```), implement a 2–3 frame animation.

| Variant | Country | Pattern | Function | Condition |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1 | France | a | y=x^2 | Count of numbers less than and greater than 0 |
| 2 | Bangladesh | b | y=2x+3 | Absolute sum of the first 125 numbers and the second 125 numbers |
| 3 | Netherlands | c | y=2x | Absolute sum of numbers at even and odd positions |
| 4 | Poland | d | y=x^0.5 | Absolute average of the first 125 and the second 125 numbers |
| 5 | Lithuania | e | y=\|x\| | Absolute average of numbers at even and odd positions |
| 6 | Thailand | f | y = 1 / x | Numbers greater than 5 and less than 5, discard negatives |
| 7 | Japan | g | y = 3x | Numbers greater than -5 and less than -5, discard positives |
| 8 | Benin | h | y = x + 1 | Numbers from 0 to 5 and numbers from 0 to -5, discard the rest |
| 9 | Finland | i | y = x / 2 | Numbers from 5 to 10 and numbers from -5 to -10, discard the rest |
